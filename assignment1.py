# Problem 1. Lambda function, list, class and sort function.
# using lambda function to sort a list of objects.  Create a list of actors using the 
# above Actor class and then sort the list using first name and last name respectively.

# Problem 2. Dictionary usage. 
# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a 
# specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you 
# may not use the same element twice.
# Example: Given nums = 2, 7, 11, 15, target = 9,
# Because nums0 + nums1 = 2 + 7 = 9, return 0, 1.

# Problem 3. Input function and string operations. 
# 1) Prompt "What is your first name?" and let user to input the first name
# 2) Prompt "What is your last name?" and let user to input the last name.
# 3) Based on 1 and 2, we can get the full name by combing first name and last 
#   name. Print out "Your full name is " and the full name.
