# Problem 1. String, dictionary and list (From LeetCode)
Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

For example, given: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"], 
Return:

[
  ["ate", "eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
Note: All inputs will be in lower-case.

# Problem 2. More on list slices
For a given list of , how do you generate a new list of elements 
at even locations, and a new list of elements at odd locations

For example, given A = [1, 3, 8, 5, 12, 3, 23, 8], a new list of
elements at even locations is [1, 8, 12, 23]. A new list of elements
at odd locations is [3, 5, 3, 8]

# Problem 3. List comprehensions
For a given list of positive integers, generate a new list that contains
the squares of all the numbers that are odd in the given list. 

For example, given A = [1, 3, 8, 5, 12, 3, 23, 8], the list of numbers 
that are odd in A are [1, 3, 5, 3, 23], so we generate a new list of 
[1, 9, 25, 9, 529]
